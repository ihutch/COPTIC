\section{Apologia}

The ACCIS plotting library is a lightweight portable library that
gives fortran what it ought to have had: simple graphical output of
scientific data. There are other libraries that fulfil that purpose;
but this happens to be the one I wrote; so I like it. Also it is
entirely free and open, so it can be included in the distribution of
any program, without encumbrance. 

It is powerful. For example, it has interactive routines for
displaying selectable slices of 3-D data, rotating the views of
surfaces, projecting 2-D contours, and producing smoothly coloured
contours.

It also produces publication-quality vector-drawn postscript output,
including text and mathematical symbols.

It observes what ought to be a standard principle of scientific
programming: that the focus should be the calculation, not the
graphical interface. In other words, the fortran program calls the
graphical display, rather than what has become the standard approach
in windowing systems that the graphical interface calls the
calculation. The result is that the learning curve is easy, and one
can get started with a couple of subroutine calls.

Finally, it is written in fortran 77 (with the exception of the X or
Win32 graphics driver which need C) so if you can compile your
fortran program, you can compile the accis routines.

The best way to get into using accis is by example. So I recommend
looking at the routine \verb!plottest.f!, and others in the directory
\verb!testing!.

\section{Conventions}

For purposes of this summary, the following implicitly indicate types:
i: integer, c: character, l: logical, all others: real.  Terminating
letter indicates: v: vector (1-d array), a: 2-d array.  

There are world units, normalized (normal) units, and box units, each
has a direct scaling to the others. Users can plot in world units
standard values. Normalized x-units are 0 to 1 across the width of the
canvas and normal y-units have the same size as x-units and start at 0
at the bottom, but the top of a landscape canvas doesn't reach 1. Box
units are fractional distance 0-1 across the plot-region box, in
either direction.

\section{Automatic plotting, single call plots.}

\iftth \special{html:<a href="plottest.f"><img align="right" src="plainplot.png"></a>}\fi
AUTOPLOT(xv,yv,ilength) Line plot yv versus xv; linear axes.

AUTOMARK(xv,yv,ilength,isym) Plot using symbol isym.

LAUTOPLOT(xv,yv,ilength,lnx,lny) Line plot with logarithmic axis in x
or y or both.

LAUTOMARK(xv,yv,ilength,lnx,lny,isym) Symbol plot with logarithmic axis(es).
 
YAUTOPLOT(yv,ilength) Line plot yv versus index; linear axes.


\section{Setup}

PLTINIT(xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax) Switch to graphics, set world scaling.

FITINIT(xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax) same but fitting nice ranges.

ACCISINIT() Shorthand call for PLTINIT(0.,1.,0.,1.).

AUTOINIT(xv,yv,ilength) Set up scaling and axes as for AUTOPLOT based
on the data, but don't actually do the plotting. This is useful if one
wishes e.g.\  to change the color of the line before it is plotted by
a call to POLYLINE.

LAUTOINIT(xv,yv,ilength,lnx,lny) Set up possibly logarithmic scaling
and axes, without drawing.

AUTO3INIT(xv,yv,zv,ilength) Set up scaling for autoplot in 3D. Call poly3line
subsequently to draw.

SCALEWN(xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,lnx,lny) Set world scaling explicitly, possibly log.

FITSCALE(xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,lnx,lny) same but fitting nice ranges.

PLTINASPECT(xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax) Initiate graphics. Resize axis region
to retain aspect ratio of plot with x,y in the same units. Set world scaling.

AXREGION(xin,xan,yin,yan) Set the axis region in normal units.
Default: .31,.91,.1,.7, which is reset if xin=xan=0.

AXPTSET(xfrac,yfrac) Set the primary axis point (i.e. intersection) at
specified fraction of the plot region (i.e.\ in box units). (Default
0.,0.)

MULTIFRAME(irows,icolumns,ispace) For subsequent plots (using pltinit),
plot irows x icolumns plots per page, with label space determined by
ispace (bit0 implies space x, bit1 y). Call with irows=0, single frame.

PFSET(inum) Set file plotting for hardcopy. inum=(0:no, 1:hp, 2:ps, 3:eps).
If inum.eq.-1, then prompt for choice. If inum.lt.-1 output to file
only, not screen.

PFILNOSET(inum) Set the plot file number so that the next plot
initialization will use the file number inum+1.

PFPSSET(ips) Set the use of postscript character fonts (ips=1) or vector
drawn fonts (0, default), or (3) use the value previous to current.
Can be turned on and off during the plot. Has no effect on screen
display, only on postscript output.

IPFPS() Return value of PFPS setting.

WINSET(lwin) Set windowing to axis-region on or off (.false. default).

TRUNCF(xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax) Set rectangular truncation (windowing) norm-units.
If all args=0, switch off (default).

PLTEND() Flush graphics, wait for mouse click in plotting window; then
return.

PRTEND('cformat') Terminate graphics frame without waiting or closing
windows. The string cformat, if longer than 2 characters [else do
nothing extra], specifies a format string expecting a write of one
character variable, being the output filename, into a system call,
e.g. to do automatic graphics conversion.

\section{Data plotting}

POLYLINE(xv,yv,ilength) Draw a polyline on an already setup graph.

YPOLYLINE(yv,ilength) Draw a polyline on an already setup yautoplot.

POLYMARK(xv,yv,ilength,isym) Draw data marked by symbols isym:
1 hollow square, 2 hollow triangle, 3 bullet, 4 solid square, 5 solid 
triangle, 6 hollow star, 7 solid star, 8 hollow diamond, 9 flag, 10 +,
11 x, 12 diamond, 13 -, 14 inverted triangle, 15 circle. Else
char(isym), so ichar('c') gives 'c', ichar('c')+128 gives the font-2
symbol corresponding to 'c' (xi).

DASHSET(idash) Set dashed line character for polyline. 
(0:solid, 1:long, 2:short, 3:long/short, 4:dots)

LABELINE(xv,yv,ilength,clabel,ilablen) Draw polyline of ilength
points, with embedded label, clabel, of length ilablen characters. If
ilablen.eq.-99 then set the normalized interval between labels to
xv(1); if xv(1).eq.0 set it to default 0.3.

POLYDRAW(xv,yv,ilength,DRAWFN) Draw data marked by symbol defined by
the routine DRAWFN, a subroutine accepting 2 real arguments, being the
normalized x and y position of the symbol center, which draws the symbol.
Specify EXTERNAL DRAWFN in the calling routine. Built-in routines are
ACCIRCLE, ACTRID, ACAST, ACX, ACPLUS.

ACGEN(x,y) is a general routine to be passed to POLYDRAW that will draw a
user-defined symbol without having to define an actual
function. Instead the subroutine 

ACGSET(xv,yv,ilength,ifill) is called
first with arguments giving the symbol vertices in units of the
charsize, and calling for filling of the symbol if ifill .ne. 0.
Thereafter acgen generates the symbol specified. Since the width and
height are scaled by chrswdth and chrshght, aspect-ratio can be scaled
using charsize().

POLYERRS(xv,yv,errv,ilength,u,d) Draw error bars from yv-d*errv to
yv+u*errv for all the xv, yv, errv arrays.

POLYBOX(xv,yv,ilength) Draw the outline of a histogram of boxes whose
(touching) boundaries are at xv(0:ilength) and whose heights are
yv(ilength). Ends have y=0. Notice that there is one more xv than yv!

STPOLYLINE(xa,ya,ilength,ixstride,iystride),

STPOLYMARK(xa,ya,ilength,ixstride,iystride,isym) Strided versions of
polyline/mark, in which a total of ilength data points are sampled
from the arrays xa and ya at strides of ixstride and iystride. These
allow one to plot data from rows (rather than columns) of a matrix by
passing the leading dimension of the matrix as the stride. Passing
strides of 1 gives sampling equivalent to the unstrided versions.

POLYGAPLINE(xv,yv,ilength,logicalv) Draw polylines using total
length ilength of arrays xv, and yv. The lines join all and only
contiguous indices at which the logicalv array is true.

POLYCOLORLINE(xv,yv,ilength,ipcolorv) Draw a polyline whose color
varies as a function of index in accordance with the integer vector
ipcolorv, whose significant range should be 1-240.

POLYCOLORGAPLINE(xv,yv,ilength,ipcolorv,logicalv) A combination of the
two previous functionalities; color code a gap line.

\section{Color}

\iftth \special{html:<a href="filltest.f"><img align="right" src="filltest.png"></a>}\fi
COLOR(icol) Set current discrete color of 0-15. Default 15 black (on
white). If icol$>$15, then instead call GRADCOLOR(icol-15).

GRADCOLOR(icol) Set current color from a 1-240 color gradient range.

ACCISGRADINIT(ir1,ig1,ib1,ir2,ig2,ib2) Set the gradient linear color
range start and end, rgb amplitudes 0-65535.

ACCISGRADSET(iredv,igreenv,ibluev,npixel) Set the color gradient with
arbitrary RGB values from vectors of length npixel.

IGETCOLOR() Integer function.  Get the number of the current
color. [0-15 discrete, 16-256 a gradient color].

PATHFILL() Fill the path just drawn, with the current color. A path is
a set of vectors all drawn with pen down one after the other.

IDARKBLUE(), IDARKGREEN(),  ISKYBLUE(),  IBRICKRED(),  IPURPLE(),
IGOLD(),  IGRAY(),  ILIGHTGRAY(),  IBLUE(),  IGREEN(),  ICYAN(),
IRED(),  IMAGENTA(),  IYELLOW(),  IBLACK(): Integer functions returning
the discrete 16-color number that gives what their name indicates ($=1-15$).

GRADTRI(xv,yv,zv,dv,zg0,zg1,ng0,ng1,isw) shade triangle specified by
vertices xv(3), yv(3)[, zv(3)], with gradient values dv(3). The
lower/upper parameter values zg0,1 are mapped to gradient colors
ng0,1. isw bit 0 sets 2D (0) or 3D (1); bit 1 indicates use of dv:
either absolute parameter values (0), or as direction cosines (1), in
which case value is the point (xv,yv,zv) coordinate in that direction.

GRADQUAD(xqv,yqv,zqv,dqv,zg0,zg1,ig0,ig1,isw) fill a quadrilateral 
by splitting into four triangles at the centroid and using GRADTRI. 

GRADLEGEND(c1,c2,x1,y1,x2,y2,colwidth,lpara) draw a color gradient
axis-legend. Value corresponding to color goes from c1 to c2: the ends of
the color gradient. Position of axis is (x1,y1) to (x1,y2) in axis-box
units. Width of color bar is colwith times axis-box
width. lpara=.true. says use parallel labels.

AXIS() Automatic x and y axis.

AXIS2() Put tics on the opposite side of the axis box.

XAXIS(first,delta) Draw an axis; labels starting at first, spaced by delta.
If delta=0, autofit labels, which is what AXIS() does for both axes.

YAXIS(first,delta) If axis is log, first indicates major subtic.

ALTXAXIS(xi,xa) Draw an alternative xaxis whose ends have world values
scaled by the factors xi and xa.

ALTYAXIS(yi,ya) Normally the axis position would be moved by
axptset(1.,1.) and probably ticrev(), all manually, before drawing.

AXLABELS(cxlab,cylab) Label the x/y axes with strings.

BOXTITLE(ctitle) Label the plot with a string centered at the top.

GAXIS(amin,amax, igpow,first,delta, xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax, lpara,laxlog)
General axis with ends positioned at (xmin, ymin) (xmax, ymax) normal
units. World axis labels based on world end values amin, amax, first, delta,
igpow (power of ten label).  Lpara puts labels parallel (else
dperp). Laxlog logarithmic.

AXPTSET(xpt,ypt) Set the axis intersection point at specified fractions of
the full lengths of the axes. This determines where the axes are drawn.

TICSET(xlen,ylen,xoff,yoff,ixw,iyw,ixp,iyp) Set tic lengths, label
offsets, widths, decimal points. Labels switched off by width
ixw$\le$0. Defaults set respectively if reals all =0 or ints all
=0. (Defaults: .015,.015,-.03,-.02,4,4,1,1)

TICREV() Reverse the tics and labels to the other side of axis.

TICLABTOG() Toggle the tic labels on and off.

TICNUMSET(itics) Set the number of tics of axis (approximately).

\section{Text plotting}

\iftth \special{html:<img align="right" src="fontshow.png">} \fi

the following embedded in the string passed to routines:
\begin{verbatim}
@        to normal font 0.
A        to font 1 (math)
B        to font 2 (italic)
R        to font 3 (roman)

s        Toggle small character mode (e.g. small caps)
\end{verbatim}


JDRWSTR(xn,yn,cstring,just) Draw cstring at (xn,yn)(normal), justified
per parameter just:  0. centered, +1. normal left-justified, etc.

DRCSTR(cstring) Draw cstring from current position. Leave at end of string.

CHARSIZE(width,height) Set character size. (0,0) sets default.

PCHARSIZE Restore character size prior to the last CHARSIZE call.

CHARANGL(theta) Set character angle to horizontal in degrees.

PCHARANGL Restore character angle prior to the last CHARANGL call. 

GETCANGL(theta) Get character angle to horizontal in degrees.

prior to the first such call, default size is 0.018. 

ANNOTE [DOS only] Enter interactive annotation mode. Type help for help.

GETFONT(fontname) Read a new fontset from file.

LEGENDLINE(xg,yg,nsym,cstring) Draw a legendline at fractional
position in plot box: xg, yg.  Use symbol nsym if positive and $\le$256.
If nsym$<$0 use both line and symbol. If nsym=0 put only line.  
If nsym=257 use nothing but put the string at the usual place.
If nsym=258 use nothing but put the string at the start of the line.

\section{Contouring}

\iftth \special{html:<a href="contest.f"><img align="right" src="contest.png"></a>}\fi

CONTREC(za,cworka,ixm,iym,zclv,icl) Simple contour of entire array za(ixm, iym)
at levels zclv(icl). If icl=0 fit contour levels instead. If icl.lt.0 no
line labels. Cworka is a work character array at least (ixm, iym).

CONTOURL(za,cworka,iLdim,ixm,iym,zclv,icl,x,y,icsw) General contour
za(1:ixm(of ildim), iym) at zclv(icl). If icl=0, or icl$<$-998, fit
contours using zclv(1) if non-zero to determine contour number. On a
mesh defined by x,y. Switch icsw determines call type: 0 equal
spacing, x,y not used; 1 vectors x,y determine mesh; 2 arrays x,y
determine mesh; bit 5 (16) sets coloring; bit 6 (32) omits contour
lines; bit 7 (64) color-fills with triangle gradients, in which case
non-zero second byte (*256) determines the step size of the gradients
(1 by default). Color gradient contouring should be done with icl
.ge. 2 and the minimum and maximum values in zclv(1) and
zclv(icl). Then a gradlegend can be constructed with these values.
Third byte (*65536) if non-zero sets filling of (usually one level of)
closed contour by the integer color to which it corresponds, and turns
off contour lines (which might therefore have to be drawn later on
top). Contour filling doesn't work perfectly for contours that
intersect more than one border.

CONT3PROJ(za,cworka,iLdim,ixm,iym,zclv,icl,x,y,icsw,f) Draw a contour
plot projected on to the z=f*scbz3 (constant) plane of a 3-D
plot. Axes etc can be added manually. To end projection call
hdprset(0,0.). All the arguments but the last are those of CONTOURL.

CONTOUR(za,xa,ya,ix,iy,zclv,icl) Simple contour over mesh xa,ya of entire
arrays, needing no extra work space. No line labelling.

AUTOCONTOUR(za,iLdim,nx,ny) Simple wrapper for CONTOUR without x,y 
or cl arrays, allowing used part of za(iLdim,ny) not to be the entire array.

AUTOCOLCONT(za,iLdim,ixm,iym) Color contour za on rectangular mesh.

ARROWPLOT(E1,E2,Erange,Li,imax,jmax,x,y,iasw) Plot arrows to represent
vector whose x-,y-components are E1(imax(or Li),jmax),E2(imax,jmax),
defined on the position vectors/arrays represented by x,y. iasw works
like icsw (see CONTOURL). Arrow length is 1 normalized unit times
E/Erange. Plot region should be setup up prior to
call.

\section{Projected 3-D surface routines}

\iftth \special{html:<a href="hidtest.f"><img align="right" src="hidtest.png"></a>}\fi

HIDWEB(xv,yv,za,iL,ix,iy,isw) Draw a 3-D web of za(ix,iy) (leading
dimension iL) at xv,yv.  View obtained from file eye.dat (3 reals) or
default if nonexistent. Control switch isw: .lt.0 no axes.
Lowest byte abs(isw)=
\begin{verbatim}
0 don't rescale, use last scaling and perspective
1 scale to fit 1-D range xv(1)-xv(ix), yv(1)-yv(iy), zmin-zmax.
2 scale to 2-D xmin,xmax, ...; don't hide lines, just wiremesh.
Bit3 set [4]. Do no perspective setting regardless.
\end{verbatim}

Higher bytes: {2nd} (*256) color of web if non-zero. {3rd} (*65536) color
of axes (if !=0). (Remains set).

SURF3D(xa,ya,za,iL,ix,iy,isw,worka) Draw an opaque 3-d surface of
za(ix,iy), (leading dimension iL) at xa(ix,iy),ya(ix,iy).  View
obtained from file eye.dat (3 reals) or default if nonexistent. Switch
isw: .lt.0 no axes; lowest nibble =0 or 4 use last scale, if =0 xa, ya
must be 2-D arrays; =1 scale to fit x,y (1-D) and xa,ya are vectors,
=2 scale to fit xa,ya (2-D arrays). Second byte (*256) color of web if
non-zero. Third byte (*65536) color of axes (if !=0). (Remains
set). Second nibble (16+) is isw for the SURFDR3 call. Array
worka(0:iL+1,0:iy+1) must be provided.  Surface is normally (isw=0)
drawn as quadrilaterals filled with gradient-color according to (za)
height scaled to the total height. This is the higher level routine
with built in scaling etc., similar to hidweb but with shaded surfaces.

SURFDR3(xa,ya,za,iL,ix,iy,worka,isw[,dv]) Draw 3-D surface using current
projection. Switch isw bit 0 set: triangular fills, else chunks.  If,
in addition, isw bit 1: directional shading using optional argument
dv(5) dv(1-3) gives direction dv(4-5) gives distance limits, else
z-height shading. Use for drawing closed parameterized surfaces.

AXON(xv,yv,za,iL,ix,iy) Plot axonometrically za(ix,iy) at xv,yv (i.e.
staggered slices at constant y, no perspective).  Use eye.dat data, if
exists; first two values indicate normal distance offset of axis end.

WEBDRW(xv,yv,za,iL,ix,iy,icorner) Draw  a 3-D web using current projection.
Return closest corner to view point in icorner.

HIDINIT(top,bot) Set the top and bottom hiding horizons (usually 0.,1.).

HDPRSET(isw,fxd) Set hiding and 2-3 projection per switch isw. Zero
off.  Positive: hiding only. Negative: hiding and projection with
fixed coordinate either (x,y,or z) for isw=(-1,-2 or -3) having value
fxd. For left handed system, isw=(-4,-5 or -6).

HDPROJECT(ihide,iproject,ifixedcoord,fxdworld,irlsys)
Set hiding (ihide = 1), projecting 2$\rightarrow$3 (iproject.ne.0), which
coordinate to hold fixed (ifixedcoord), what its world value is
(fxdworld), and right (+1) or left (-1) handed system (irlsys).

CONT3PROJ(za,cworka,iLdim,ixm,iym,zclv,icl,x,y,icsw,f) Project onto 
a z=constant plane in a 3-D plot at height f. The arguments and plot
are those of contourl.

\section{Three-Dimensional Perspective Drawing}

POLY3LINE(xv,yv,zv,ilength) Draw a polyline in 3-D. (Minimum setup
call prior to this is just pltinit.)

SCALE3(xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,zmin,zmax) Set 3-D world scaling to cube
size. Defaults min=-1, max=+1.

SETCUBE(xc,yc,zc,xcen,ycen) Set norm-value of cube edges (+-) and 2-d 
position of cube center. Defaults .25,.25,.2,.5,.4.

TRN32(x,y,z,xt,yt,zt,ifl) If ifl=1, set 3-D transform; (x,y,z) is
point looked at, (xt,yt,zt) is eye. If ifl=2, set axonometric, offset
xt,zt.  If ifl=0 transform (x,y,z) to (xt,yt). If ifl=-1 return eye 
position in xt,yt,zt.

CUBEPROJ() Draw the cube outline faces closest to eye.

IGETCORNER() Integer function returning the closest corner to eye.

AXPROJ(ic) Draw axes, centered at corner given by ic.
Corner=bits0-3(ic). If bit4(ic)=1, flip labels.  If bit5(ic)=1,
x-labels vertical; if bit6(ic)=1, y-labels vertical, else horizontal.
Normally AXPROJ(IGETCORNER()).

CUBED(icorner) Draw a cube outline when icorner is the nearest.
Code is 1,2,3,4 anticlockwise (from top) from x3min,y3min, + top - bottom.

AXIDENT3() Identify the 3 axes (logically x, y, z).

AX3LABELS(charx,chary,charz) Label the three 3-D axes.

HIDVECN(x2,y2,ipen) Draw a (2-D) vector, hiding appropriately.

SCBN(icoord) Real function returns normalized value position of cube face
corresponding to coordinate icoord=constant (icoord =1,2,3). So for
example to project onto the z=constant (negative) face of the cube,
you do: call hdprset(-3,-scbn(3))

TN2S(px,py,sx,sy) Transform normalized px,py to screen coordinates
sx,sy. If (world3.h) ihiding is $<0$, project in direction of 3-d axis
mod(abs(ihiding),2) at value fixedn, right/left-handed when
$(1\le-ihiding\le3 )$ or $(4\le-ihiding\le 6)$.

EYE3D(isw) Enter interactive rotation of the view of 3-D drawing. The
routine responds to a mouse drag in the window. On button release the
routine exits with isw=1 if motion occured or isw=0 if no
motion. Normally motion calls for a redraw of the plot and reentering
eye3d, while no motion is the signal to continue. Thus the following
code gives interactive examination of the object:

\verb! 51     Continue!

\verb!        Drawing commands ...!

\verb!        call eye3d(isw)!

\verb!        if(isw.ne.0)goto 51!


Key presses with focus in the plot window, return isw= keysym of key
pressed. For example in X, left, up, right, down cursor arrows are
ff51-4 respectively (65361-4 decimal). Letters are their lower case
ASCII codes, etc.  The return value can be used for other control
purposes. But the codes for cursors are different under Windows
(37-40) and it returns the ASCII codes for upper case.
 
IEYE3D() Integer function of convenience to return switch value of eye3d.

ROTATEZOOM(isw) Called immediately after eye3d sets isw, this routine
adjusts the perspective by zooming-view (z,x), rotating-view (e,r), or
moving in/out (i,o). The drawing code that is then repeated ought not
to set the perspective explicitly (through a call to trn32) else a
call to puteye must be inserted after rotatezoom to ensure the eye.dat
is updated, otherwise the adjustment will be overridden.

IROTATEZOOM() Integer function that calls eye3d, rotatezoom, and
puteye returning the isw value of eye3d. Use isw=irotatezoom() instead
of call eye3d(isw) for functionality with wider routines (e.g. hidweb). 

DRAW3ARROW(arrowdata) Draw a 3-D arrow according to settings of
arrowdata(10): Base position world coords (3), Point position (3),
Barb parallel, perp size as fraction of length (2). 
Feather size parallel, perp, frac of length (2). If barbperp arrow(8)
is negative, then arrowplot must have total length 12, and the last
two parameters control (11) the number of barb angles and (12) whether the barb
is filled or not.

ARG3ARROW(a1,a2,a3,a4,a5,a6,a7,a8,a9,a10[,a11,a12]) call DRAW3ARROW
with explicitly passed individual arguments.

\section{Plotting volumetric 3-D Data}

\iftth \special{html:<a href="slicetest.f"><img align="left"
src="sgweb.jpg" width="400"></a>}\fi


SLICESIMPLE(ifullv,iudsv,u,startsv,endsv,nw,zp) Simple interface to
SLICEGWEB slice plotting, assuming that the array values are on a
uniform 3D mesh of index 1 to iudsv(3) starting and ending at startsv(3)
endsv(3), with workspace of nw*nw provided in zp.


SLICEGWEB(ifullv,iudsv,u,nw,zp,ixnpv,xnv,ifix,cutitle,svec,vp) Plot
as 3-D webs slices through 3-D array u. ifullv(3) and iudsv(3) are the
full and used dimensions of u. zp(nw,nw) is a work array; nw should be
$>$max(iudsv). ixnpv(3) are the pointers within xnv to the node
position array starts. That is, the positions of the nodes in
dimension id are stored in xnv(ixnpv(id))+1 to xnv(ixnpv(id))+
iudsv(id). ifix is the initial fixed dimension (1,2 or 3). cutitle is
the character array title of u. Keyboard control of the slice is
provided, together with perspective view controlled by mouse. If the
third bit of abs(ifix) is set (by adding 4 to it), then overplot on
the contour plot arrows representing the projection of the vector
field svec(ifullv,3), which has the same indexing and positions as u,
and three vector components. The work array vp(nw,nw,2) must be
provided.  The last two arguments may be dummy in the call if
abs(ifix)$<$4. More complicated ifix switches are in its higher bits.
Consult slicing.f for details.

SLICEGCONT(ifullv,iudsv,u,nw,zp,ixnpv,xnv,ifixptv,cutitle,svec,vp) Plot
perspective view of slices on which are contours of 3-D array
u(ifullv(1),ifullv(2),ifullv(3)). ifullv(3), iudsv(3), zp(nw,nw),
ixnpv(3), cutitle are as above in slicegweb. The initial intersection
of the 3 fixed planes is at ifixptv(3). Slightly different
keyboard/mouse control is provided. Overplotting arrows is indicated
by the third bit of ifix being set; the work array vp(nw,nw,3,3)
must then be provided.

IXNPCREATE(Nx,Ny,Nz,xposv,yposv,zposv,ixnpv,xnv) Is a utility that
creates the vectors ixnpv,xnv, needed for slicegweb and slicegcont
from three coordinate arrays: xposv,yposv,zposv, of lengths Nx,Ny,Nz.

IXNPCONSTRUCT(ndims,imax,iuds,xyzmesha,ixnpv,xnv) Is a general
dimensioned form of the same thing but uses an array
xyzmesha(imax,ndims) instead of separate position vectors.

SETAX3CHARS(ca,cb,cc) Set the default labels for 3 axes of 3-D data
from character variables.

\section{Primitives}

VECW(x,y,ipen) Draw world-unit vector to (x,y) with pen up (ipen=0) or
down (1). If ipen=-1, then just put a point at (x,y).

VECN(x,y,ipen) Draw norm-unit vector to (x,y) with pen up (0) or down (1).

WX2NX(wx), WY2NY(wy) Real functions convert world to normal units.

XN2XW(wx), YN2YW(wy) Real functions convert normal to world units.

VEC3W(x,y,z,ipen) Draw world vector to (x,y,z).

VEC3N(x,y,z,ipen) Draw norm vector to (x,y,z). Domain (-1.,1.) covers
the cube.

WXYZ2NXYZ(xw,yw,zw,xn,yn,zn) Transform from world 3-D vector to
normalized.

GTIC(xgw,ilab,xg,yg,tcos,tsin,axcos,axsin,lpara) Low level tic drawing.

GETEYE(x,y,z) Return the position of view in 3-D perspective plots.

PUTEYE(x,y,z) Set the position of view.

\section{Utilities}

FITRANGE(min,max,itics,ipow,fac10,delta,first,xlast) Fit a maximum of
itics ticks to range (min, max). Decide a scaling factor 10$^{\rm
ipow}$=fac10 and a sensible (scaled) delta between tics. First (xlast)
is integer multiple of delta lying closest to min (max) outside the
range (min,max). So (first+i*delta) are the tick values.

MINMAX(xv,isize,min,max) Find min and max of vector of size isize.

MINMAX2(xa,iL1,ix,iy,min,max) Find min and max of 2-d array of
leading dimension iL1, over indices (ix,iy).

STEPLOG(i,pmax,n,nsteps,stepa) Return the ith of n steps of p up to a
ceiling of pmax in logarithmic spacing of nsteps specified in stepa
e.g. nsteps=3, stepa=(1,2,5) or 4, (1,2,4,6)


FWRITE(x,iwdth,ipoint,cstring) Format write the float x into cstring
with specified ipoint decimal places. Total width returned as iwdth.

IWRITE(i,iwdth,cstring) Format the integer i into cstring, return iwdth.

TERMCHAR(cstring) Terminate the string in 0, truncating trailing spaces.

ACCISFLUSH() Flush all graphics to the display before proceeding. This
is useful if the program is about to enter a polling state, waiting
for input. It ensures that all the prior display of graphics is visible on
entering that polling state.

ASLEEP(iusec) Insert a delay of approximately iusec microsec into both
live plotting and ps files, for making sequential drawing animations.
Timing will be much slower over remote Xservers and serious bandwidth
wasted because delays are generated by writing to the screen. When
playing such ps files using ghostscript, the duration can be changed
by an arbitrary (real) factor by predefining the gs macro SF using a
command such as

gs -c /SF 2.5 def -f plot0001.ps

which causes the animation duration to be multiplied by 2.5

RECTROUND(x1,y1,x2,y2,rx,ry,nr,xv,yv) Construct a rounded-corner
rectangle in the arrays xv, yv, length (4*nr+1). The vertices of the
rectangle are x1,y1 and x2,y2. The radius of curvature of the rounded
corners are rx, ry. nr is the number of points devoted to the curved
corner polylines.


\section{Linking}

The routines are normally compiled and gathered into a library
\verb!libaccis...! which is subsequently linked against. Compiling is
accomplished by issuing the simple command \verb!$ make!. The makefile
searches for a fortran compiler and builds the library if
successful. If it can't find one, then e.g. \verb!$ make G77=path90!
tells it the name of the compiler is \verb!path90!. There are various
other \verb!make! targets that can be found in the Makefile.

The graphical output driver routines are contained in vecx.c,
vecglx.c, vecwin.c, which require a C compiler, or the obsolete but
occasionally useful vec4014.f. Of these driver files, the routines
svga, txtmode, vec, vecfill, scolor, accisgraddef, acgradcolor,
getrgbcolor are public, for calling by higher level routines, and
possibly the user.

For X window systems, the X11 driver (vecx.c=vecX11.c) requires
linking against the Xlib library using compiler/linker arguments such
as -L/usr/X11R6/lib/ -lX11.  The OpenGL driver vecglx.c requires in
addition -lGL and -lGLU. The development versions of the X11 and
OpenGL packages may be required to provide these. The driver can be
selected by e.g. \verb!$ make VECX=vecx! or \verb!$ make VECX=vecglx!.
These drivers reside in the library \verb!libaccisX.a!.  Non-X drivers
reside in \verb!libaccis.a! which normally needs no additional
libraries.  The make command \verb!$ make VECX=noscreen!  like
\verb!$ make VECX=vec4014!  makes a version which requires only a
fortran compiler (no C). The noscreen option outputs no graphics to
screen and does not wait for any input. It will however generate
postscript plot files if the code calls for them.


All the ACCIS code with the exception of the drivers is fortran 77.
It takes advantage of the ubiquitous essential extensions: long
variable names and include statements, that make F77 still viable
today.  By virtue of fortran policy, it is therefore also fully
compliant with the 1990, 1995, 2003, 2008 etc., fortran standards,
without modification\footnote{This might no longer be true since
  latest versions of fortran compilers often check on the consistency
  of arguments passed to fortran routines and declare (spuriously) an
  error if they do not agree in rank. A work around is to use the
  compile flag \texttt{-fallow-argument-mismatch}.}. However, when it is being
called from modern (post 77) fortran, it may be advantageous for
debugging purposes to use explicit interface definitions in the
calling program. The file \verb!interface.f90! will be generated by
\verb!$ make interface.f90!  and can then be included in fortran code
compiled with a F90 (or later) compiler. The explicit interface helps
the compiler detect erroneous argument parameters to subroutine
calls. It is not necessary for operation of debugged correct code.

Running under X, displayed window size is by default 800x600
pixels. This default can be overridden by command line arguments of
the form (e.g.)  \verb!-geometry 1600x1200!, or by providing
Xresources (in files .Xdefaults or .Xresources) of the standard form
\verb!Accis.Geometry: 1600x1200+400+0! (case matters). If this size
exceeds the screen size, at initiation the window is scaled down so
its height is 0.75 of the screen height.  On large screens, wider than
2400 pixels, the drawn line width is automatically increased to
improve readability. None of these display settings influences the
postscript file output.
